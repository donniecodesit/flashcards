# Flashcards
### Project worked on during Week 10 of my Thinkful Software Engineering Course
This application was built using React, utilizing functional programming with JavaScript and page elements using HTML (with bootstrap).
It is an interactive application where you can manage decks of cards to study. You can edit, delete, or manage them however you'd like!

To run this project locally, simply download, clone, or fork this repository to a new folder.
Afterwards, run `npm install` to install `node_modules`, and afterwards, run `npm start`.
This will start up a local database server and the client page! Enjoy!
