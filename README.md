# Flashcards Application
This is an interactive application where you can view, manage, and study decks of cards. you can also edit, delete, or manage them however you'd like!
This was built using React, utilizing functional programming with JavaScript and React Componenets, using JSX and Bootstrap, during Week 10 of my Software Engineering Course at Thinkful.
